Conducting review and logging the defects

1.During your project delivery stage, which items underwent reviews?
All operation including Creating,Viewing,Deleting,Updating underwent reviews.

2.What were the different types of reviews carried out ?
   Inspection and  Technical review 

3.Detail  the steps involved in the reviews conducted.

The defects found are documented in a logging list or issue log.
A formal follow-up is carried out by the moderator applying exit criteria.

The defects were logged into Defect Log sheet.

5.What were the templates used?
Defect log templates was used.

2.Detail the steps involved in the status reporting. Showcase recent status report.

Step 1:Status report template was generated
step 2:Once the template has been generated,the start and end date details is filled by one of the tea mmember in that particular project.
step 3:The status sof the project is recorded and submited to the client.

3.List the documents referred to prepare status report and list the recipients?
